Note:
The OpenAI API quota for this AI-Powered Smart Resume Builder project has been exhausted. Therefore, when you try to improve the resume summary using the AI feature, you may receive a "No Response from API" or similar error. This behavior is expected until the API quota is renewed or increased.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

# React + Vite

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
